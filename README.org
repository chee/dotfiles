* Literate ~/dotfiles/...
Using =org= and =babel=. Press =C-c C-v t= to create the file.

This is my collection of GNU/Linux configuration files. I use [[http://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html][gnu stow]] to keep everything in a single, version controlled, directory.

For example, after cloning, run:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
cd ~/dotfiles/
stow emacs
#+END_SRC

This creates symlinks for each file/folder in the specified directory, i.e. the =/emacs= folder, appear in the parent directory, which in this case will be the home directory.

* Current Setup
I am currently using:

| wm       | xmonad     | 
| panel    | xmobar     |
| shell    | zsh + tmux |
| terminal | urxvt      |
| editor   | emacs      |
