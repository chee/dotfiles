#+TITLE: Literate ~/dotfiles/...

This is my attempt at literate GNU/Linux configuration files. To achieve this, I am using [[http://orgmode.org][org-mode]] and [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html][babel]] for [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][emacs]]. I am also using [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/stow.html][stow]] to keep everything in a single, version controlled, directory.

* Current Setup
I am currently using:

| wm       | [[file:xmonad.org][xmonad]]     |
| panel    | [[file:xmonad.org][xmobar]]     |
| shell    | [[file:zshrc.org][zsh]] + tmux |
| terminal | urxvt      |
| editor   | [[file:emacs/.emacs.d/starting.org][emacs]] [[file:emacs][ ]]    |

* How it works
** Stow
To organize my dotfiles, I am using [[http://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html][this]] approach. The =~/dotfiles= directory contains a subdirectory for each applications' configuration files.

For example, the =~/dotfiles/xmonad/.xmonad/= directory holds all of the XMonad configuration files. Once all the files are created, use:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  stow xmonad
#+END_SRC

to create a symlink, =~/.xmonad=, pointing to =~/dotfiles/xmonad/.xmonad/=

You only need run =stow= initially, or if any other new files are added. Once the symlink is created, you can open the file within the home directory and it will use the symlinked file within =~/dotfiles=.

** Org and Babel
Babel allows you to put code snippets with an org file and then use =:tangle <directory>= to combine the snippets to a file in the specified directory.

For example, if you wanted to create your XMonad configuration file and store it in =~/dotfiles/.xmonad/xmonad.hs=, you would use:
#+BEGIN_SRC org -r -k
  ,#+BEGIN_SRC haskell :tangle ~/dotfiles/xmonad/.xmonad/xmonad.hs
  <Insert code snippet here...>
  ,#+END_SRC
#+END_SRC

You can edit the code in the =SRC= block by pressing <C-c '>  This opens the snippet in a new buffer in the languages native mode. Press <C-c '> again to save the changes.

Once you are happy with the changes, press <C-c C-v t> to =tangle= (combine in this case) all the snippets and create =xmonad.hs= inide of =~/dotfiles/xmonad/.xmonad=.

If you wanted to simplify things a bit, you could avoid using =stow= and only use =org-mode= and =babel= by pointing tangle to the home directory instead, i.e. =~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs=
